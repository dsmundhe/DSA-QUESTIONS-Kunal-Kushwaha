### 1. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/cells-with-odd-values-in-a-matrix/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/cells-with-odd-values-in-a-matrix/description/)

##### Problem Description:

There is an `m x n` matrix initialized to all 0's.  
A 2D array `indices` is given where each `indices[i] = [ri, ci]` represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

### 2. Maximum Population year

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/description/)

##### Problem Description:

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `i-th` person.
The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `i-th` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the inclusive range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is **not counted** in the year that they die.
Your task is to return the **earliest year** with the maximum population.

**Problem Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-whether-matrix-can-be-obtained-by-rotation/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-whether-matrix-can-be-obtained-by-rotation/description/)

#### Problem Description

You are given two \( n \times n \) binary matrices `mat` and `target`. Return `true` if it is possible to make `mat` equal to `target` by rotating `mat` in 90-degree increments (clockwise). Otherwise, return `false`.
