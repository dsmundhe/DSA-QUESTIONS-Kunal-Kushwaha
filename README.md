## About

This repository is dedicated to my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. It includes various implementations and solutions, each focusing on understanding and improving algorithmic efficiency and problem-solving skills.

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures: Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, etc.
- Solutions to popular algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and more.
- Practice problems from online platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
- Code is documented and organized for easy readability and reusability.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - All implementations and solutions are written in Java.
- **JUnit** (Optional) - For testing some data structures and algorithms.
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control and collaboration.

## Installation
